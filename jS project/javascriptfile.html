        <h1> WELCOME TO PAT 9: PROJECT YOUR JAVA SCRIPT LEVEL ONE PROJECT!</h1>
        <p>For this project you will be building a generic website that will seem to ask mundane questions to normal user, but you secretly are looking for a spy! anyone visiting your website will be asked a series of questions, only the spy will be able to give specific answers to you expect. If all questions are answered correctly, you will post a secret message in sonsole for the spy to read
        </p>
        <p>Here are the conditons you will check for the spy</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The spy has the same first letter of her first Name  and last name</li>
          <li>The spy is between thwe age of 20 and 30 (exclusive of 20 and 30)</li>
          <li>the spy has a pet name that ends with the letter "Y"</li>
          <p>We are going to leave the project a little more open-ended, but if you feel like you need more guidance, check out the solution walkthrough videos!. but belive it or not.
            We've actully coverd everything you need to know to complete this task. would you suggest you use Javascript to prompt the user for information and seat these to variables. Then use these
            variable to check for the four conditions to all be true. its up to you what the secret message is!
          </p>
          <p> A spy with following information should see your secret message :</p>
           <ul>
             <li>Jose johnson</li>
             <li>26 year old</li>
             <li>175 mm tall</li>
             <li>pet name is "pommy"</li>
             <p>keep in mind you can ask the question in whatever order you want, you can even separate asking for first name and then another prompt for last name</p>
             <p>Also remember toswitch out the script src to your own, js. file! right now its connected to part 9.js which contains solutions</p>
